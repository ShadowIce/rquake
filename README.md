#rQuake

An implementation of [Quake](https://github.com/id-Software/Quake) written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and following the [HandmadeQuake series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBKDuv-qJpTbCsXHsxcoSSsMarnfyNhHF).

##Goals
 - keep everything safe where possible
 - don't panic, ever
 - abstraction of platform code (but Windows only for first implementation)
 - high test coverage
 - performance secondary for the first implementation
